📄 DESCRIPTION:
This program performs basic arithmetic operations 
(Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division) 
using the C language. It allows the user to perform 
multiple calculations in one session until they choose to exit.

The program uses:

✅ do-while loop for repetition  
✅ validation for division by zero  
✅ formatted output for clarity  


==========================================================

⚙️ FEATURES:
- User can perform multiple operations
- Handles invalid operators gracefully
- Checks for division by zero
- Easy to use and understand
 
==========================================================
